 # :tomato: Neon Pomodoro React App
______________________________________________

Neon theme **Pomodoro Technique** web application created in React. 
It was my *first attempt* at using React, including using **useState** and **useEffect** React functionalities to gain more understanding of it.

Design made by me, inspired by Cyberpunk and 80's neon aesthetic.

  ### :briefcase: Brief -  "You are the client, you are the user, you are going to create a Pomodoro App"

"You will have use of it for a long time
You will need to use React fundamentals, States, Props, Components, Conditional Rendering and Life Cycle Events. 
Itâ€™s basic enough for you to finish it in a few days and can be built upon to be quite advanced."
